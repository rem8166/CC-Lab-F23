  <p>This french bear (a bear from france, hence the baret) is visiting Vermont for the first time and is
     excited to get the best Christian Girl Autumn photoshoot ever. Help the bear get the perfect 
     shot by throwing some leaves in the air by clicking the mouse. Don't worry though- the bear has hired 
     a professional photographer, you just have to help practice the poses.</p>
